## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)
library(alphavantager)
library(pracma)
library(patchwork)  # Optional, for combining plots
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)
theme_set(theme_light())
```

```{r}
bnd<- ETF  |> filter(symbol =='BND')


ggplot(bnd, aes(x = date)) +
  # Low to close (blue)
  geom_segment(aes(xend = date, y = low, yend = close), color = "red", alpha = 0.5,size=4) +
  # Close to high (red)
  geom_segment(aes(xend = date, y = close, yend = high), color = "green", alpha = 0.5,size=4) +
  # Close price dot
  geom_point(aes(y = close), color = "black", size =2 ) +
  labs(title = "BND: High (Red), Low (Blue), and Close (Black) Since Start of Year",
       x = "Date", y = "Price (USD)") +
  theme_minimal()

```
